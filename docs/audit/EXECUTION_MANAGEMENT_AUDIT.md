## EXECUTION + MANAGEMENT END-TO-END FLOW AUDIT (POST SL/TP FIX, MR !75)
================================================================================

Scope: full live path traced and verified against actual source on `main`:
ProcessorOutput (Python output_mapper) -> gateway guards -> BuildExecuteRequest
-> execution ExecuteTrade (validate -> size -> build -> execute, incl. the new
Step-2 min-stop check) -> MT5 bridge -> instant watcher / LIMIT TTL ->
NotifyExecutionCompleted -> RegisterFilledTradeRequest -> RegisterFilledTrade
-> in-memory Trade -> monitoring worker (SL -> TP -> BE -> trail) -> broker;
plus management restart-restore (main.go), journal repository/schema/models,
takeprofit executor, breakeven/trailing engines, invalidators, EOD.

VERDICT: the LIVE happy-path is correctly wired. The system is NOT yet fully
production-ready: there are confirmed money-affecting correctness bugs on the
restart/persistence path and in synthetic-instrument SL math. Every item below
is backed by code that was read, not assumed.

Status legend: [ ] open  [~] partial  [x] done

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### EM-C1 (CRITICAL) TP partial-close percentages are destroyed on restart
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Evidence chain (all verified):
  - journal/repository.go SchemaSQL: management_trades has NO tp1_pct/tp2_pct/
    tp3_pct columns.
  - journal/models.go TradeRecord: NO TP*Pct fields.
  - journal/repository.go InsertTrade / GetActiveTrades / GetAllActiveTrades /
    GetTradeByBrokerOrderID: pct never written or read.
  - cmd/management/main.go restoreTradeFromRecord: rebuilds Trade WITHOUT
    setting TP1Pct/TP2Pct/TP3Pct -> Go zero-value 0.
  - takeprofit/executor.go: closeVol = totalLot * tpPct / 100.0.
Consequence: after ANY management restart, restored trades have tpPct = 0 ->
closeVol = 0 -> ClosePartial(brokerID, 0). TP1 and TP2 partial closes silently
close ZERO lots. Only TP3 (fullClose -> ClosePosition) works. Because the
broker only ever holds TP1 as its order TP (see EM-M1), a restarted trade past
TP1 has neither a working broker TP nor a working software partial.
Fix: add tp1_pct/tp2_pct/tp3_pct columns + idempotent migration; add fields to
TradeRecord; write/read in InsertTrade + all SELECTs; set them in
restoreTradeFromRecord.
Status: [x] DONE — schema/model already carried the columns (merged);
  grpc_server.InsertTrade + main.restoreTradeFromRecord now write/read
  tp*_pct/point/digits/rr/remaining + flags; UpdateTradeRuntime is called
  from takeprofit (post-partial) and breakeven (post-BE); AND the LIMIT
  fill path now hands off full intent via NotifyExecutionCompleted instead
  of the lossy reconciler import (the steady-state instance of this bug).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### EM-C2 (CRITICAL) Point/Digits destroyed on restart -> BE/trailing SL math wrong
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Evidence: RegisterFilledTrade stamps trade.Point/Digits (from gateway
symbol_info), but they are NOT persisted (schema/TradeRecord/InsertTrade omit
them) and NOT restored in restoreTradeFromRecord. After restart trade.Point = 0
-> breakeven.go falls back to tradePoint = 0.0001. For synthetics/indices whose
real point differs, BE/trailing SL is computed on the wrong scale.
Fix: persist + restore point and digits alongside the trade.
Status: [x] DONE — point/digits persisted at registration + restored in
  restoreTradeFromRecord; break-even self-heals Point/Digits from broker
  GetSymbolInfo (symbol_info) + UpdateTradePointDigits when Point==0.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### EM-H1 (HIGH) Breakeven buffer uses FX-only pip model; wrong on synthetics
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Evidence: stoploss/breakeven.go:
  newSL = entryPrice +/- bufferPips * (tradePoint * 10)  // "1 pip = 10 points"
Hardcoded FX convention. The rest of the system (Python get_pip_value, execution
sizing) treats synthetics with pip = 1.0 and uses the broker's real point. On
Crash/Boom/Volatility/index symbols this yields a near-zero buffer -> breakeven
lands effectively at raw entry with no spread cushion -> trades get knocked to
BE by spread/noise. Cross-instrument inconsistency.
Fix: derive the BE/trailing buffer from a synthetic-aware pip value (same source
as execution sizing) rather than tradePoint*10. Validate per instrument class.
Status: [x] DONE — constants.PipSize(symbol,point,digits) mirrors execution
  bridge.go (synthetic=>1.0; digits<=2=>point; else point*10); breakeven.go
  buffer now uses PipSize. trailing.go has no pip-buffer term (fractional
  trail), so EM-H1 does not apply there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### EM-H2 (HIGH) Trailing stop is fractional, not structural (rulebook mismatch)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Evidence: stoploss/trailing.go trails a fixed fraction of the move from entry
(trailFractionForStyle) and documents in-code that it lacks candle/swing data,
while citing the swing-based rulebook rule (STYLE-MGMT-002 / 9.2). Behaviour
does not match documented intent; on synthetics a fixed-fraction trail can give
back large open profit.
Fix: feed structural swing levels to Module C (e.g. via the candle-closed alert
or a dedicated lookup) and trail behind the last swing, OR explicitly downgrade
the documented contract to match the implementation. Decide deliberately.
Status: [x] DONE (deliberate downgrade) — trailing.go contract doc rewritten
  to describe the implemented fractional high-water-mark trail honestly;
  swing-based trail recorded as a tracked future enhancement (needs a new
  structural feed into Module C). No math change.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### EM-M1 (MEDIUM) Broker holds only SL + TP1; TP2/TP3/BE/trailing are software-only
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Evidence: execution mt5/bridge.go and watcher fireMarketOrder send only
TakeProfit = TP1Price to the broker; takeprofit/executor.go closes TP2/TP3 by
polling tick prices. There is no broker-side OCO bracket for TP2/TP3.
Consequence: a Module C outage/restart degrades a live position to broker-SL +
broker-TP1 only (and, combined with EM-C1/EM-C2, even TP1 management is broken
after restart). Acceptable ONLY with hardened Module C HA, which is not
evidenced.
Fix: either place a broker-side bracket for the runner, or document + harden
Module C HA (and resolve EM-C1/EM-C2 so restart restores full state).
Status: [x] DONE — resolved together with EM-C3 (below). The broker now
  holds a real bracket: SL + final-target TP (TP3). EM-C1/EM-C2 make
  restart restore full state; StateReconciler adopts broker
  remaining-volume as source of truth each frame (UpdateTradeRuntime) so
  software TP sizing tracks broker reality after any outage. TP1/TP2 are
  software partials INSIDE the broker TP3 bracket, and SL moves preserve
  that TP3 (see EM-C3), so a Module C outage still leaves the runner
  protected by broker SL + broker TP3. A per-leg child-order OCO model
  (one broker order per TP) remains an optional future refinement but is
  no longer required for correctness.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### EM-C3 (CRITICAL) Broker-side TP was TP1, and SL moves cleared it
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Discovered during EM-M1 verification (full broker path read incl. the
MT5 EA). Evidence chain (all verified):
  - execution watcher fireMarketOrder + executor placeLimit set the broker
    OrderPlacement.TakeProfit = order.TP1Price on the FULL position volume.
  - ZeroMQ_EA.mq5 HandleOrderSend sets request.tp = TP1 on TRADE_ACTION_DEAL
    (market) / TRADE_ACTION_PENDING (limit); MetaApi /trade sets takeProfit.
    A position-level MT5 TP closes the ENTIRE remaining volume when hit.
  - => if price reached TP1 and the broker TP fired, MT5 closed 100% at TP1
    and TP2/TP3 + runner + break-even + trailing NEVER ran. The whole
    multi-target model was defeated by its own broker bracket.
  - breakeven.go (x2) + trailing.go called ModifyPosition(..., newTP=0).
    EA HandlePositionModify issues TRADE_ACTION_SLTP with tp=0, and
    NormalizePrice(symbol,0)=0; MT5/MetaApi treat tp=0 as REMOVE TP. So the
    first BE/trailing move wiped the broker TP entirely, leaving the runner
    with NO broker target.
Fix:
  - Broker TP at placement = final target via BrokerTakeProfit()
    (TP3 -> TP2 -> TP1) on both execution Order and management Trade.
  - Every BE/trailing/time-tighten ModifyPosition now passes
    trade.BrokerTakeProfit() instead of 0, so the SL moves while the broker
    TP3 bracket is preserved.
Status: [x] DONE

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### EM-M2 (MEDIUM) Instant-fill entry differs from sized/validated entry
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Evidence: sizing and check14MinStopDistance use EntryPrice() = entry-zone
midpoint, but INSTANT mode fills at market (fireMarketOrder Price = 0) anywhere
in the zone +/- overshoot tolerance. Realized risk (fill->SL) can differ from
the validated/sized risk (midpoint->SL). The min-stop floor is still sound; the
risk amount is approximate on instant fills.
Fix: recompute risk/lot from the actual fill price post-fill, or tighten
overshoot tolerance, or document the accepted variance.
Status: [x] DONE — fireMarketOrder rescales RiskAmount by
  (|fill-SL| / |midpoint-SL|) before handoff; exact at fixed lot size.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### EM-L1 (LOW/STRUCTURAL) ProcessorOutput contract is triplicated by hand
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Evidence: the ProcessorOutput contract is hand-maintained in three places:
proto/engine/v1/engine.proto, gateway models/processor.go, and Python
processor/models/io.py, synchronized only by `make contract-check`. A silent
rename/removal drops a field to zero downstream on money-bearing values (SL/TP/
pct/style). The Python output_mapper reshapes raw LLM JSON (entry_zone ->
midpoint+low/high, take_profits[] -> TP1/2/3 price+pct, stop_loss.price, derived
trade_valid/risk%/confidence-float); SL/TP NUMBERS pass through unchanged but
the shape boundary is a drift risk.
Fix: enforce contract-check in CI as a hard gate (fail the pipeline on drift);
consider generating one side from the proto.
Status: [x] DONE — CI lint job already runs the validator directly and
  test/test-go/build all `needs: lint`, so drift fails the pipeline. The
  local `make contract-check` no longer swallows failures with `|| echo`,
  so `make lint` now matches the CI gate.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### EM-V1 (VERIFY) MT5 order_send SL/TP attachment not yet code-verified
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Go side forwards stop_loss/take_profit to the Python bridge
/internal/broker/place_order, but src/engine/routers/broker_bridge.py (the
actual MT5 order_send call) was NOT read in this pass. MUST confirm SL/TP are
attached to the broker order (and synthetic pip handling) before live. If that
endpoint drops SL/TP, every trade is naked at the broker and only software-
managed.
Status: [x] VERIFIED — broker_bridge.py place_order forwards stop_loss +
  take_profit; MetaApiClient.place_order sends stopLoss/takeProfit on the
  /trade payload and ZmqClient.place_order sends stop_loss/take_profit on
  ORDER_SEND. Filled orders carry broker SL+TP1 (only TP1 broker-side =>
  EM-M1). The on-terminal .mq5 EA OrderSend handler is the one layer below
  the service boundary and is the remaining manual-verify item.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Verified CORRECT (no action) — recorded for completeness
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - Live SL/TP/pct/style/grade flow ProcessorOutput -> execution -> gateway
    NotifyExecutionCompleted -> RegisterFilledTradeRequest -> Trade: complete
    and consistent on the happy path.
  - New min-stop guard check14MinStopDistance runs before sizing, fails OPEN on
    missing/invalid PipSize, rejects zero/negative SL distance.
  - Idempotency via GetTradeByBrokerOrderID on both execution and management.
  - Restart-restore mechanism IS wired in main.go (GetAllActiveTrades, 30-day
    service tokens, re-register) — the mechanism exists; the restored field set
    is lossy (EM-C1/EM-C2).
  - TP closeVol > remaining clamping + realized-pct journaling handle LLM pct
    drift well.
  - Worker evaluation order SL -> TP -> BE -> trail and the checkPrice <= 0
    half-tick guard are correct.
  - Multi-tenant user_id scoping is consistent on every journal query.
  - Invalidators (structural/macro/exposure/news) gate on direction and close
    via ClosePosition with R-multiple PnL; their math relies on risk_amount /
    slDist which ARE persisted, so it survives restart.
  - Intraday EOD hard-close (16:30 UTC) is wired via the EOD scheduler.

Priority order to fix: EM-C1, EM-C2 (restart persistence) first; then EM-H1
(synthetic BE pip); then EM-V1 verification; then EM-M1/EM-H2/EM-M2/EM-L1.




THIS IS ARE SOME OF THE REASONING I COPIED SO THAT YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU WERE DOING BEFORE THE SESSION ENDED:



#### What I appended to `docs/audit/EXECUTION_MANAGEMENT_AUDIT.md`

A new section **"EXECUTION + MANAGEMENT END-TO-END FLOW AUDIT (POST SL/TP FIX, MR !75)"** documenting every issue, each with stable IDs, the exact files/code as evidence, the consequence, and the fix:

- **EM-C1 (Critical)** — TP partial-close pcts not persisted → zero-lot partials after restart.
- **EM-C2 (Critical)** — `Point`/`Digits` not persisted → wrong BE/trailing pip scale after restart.
- **EM-H1 (High)** — FX-only breakeven pip model (`point*10`) wrong on synthetics.
- **EM-H2 (High)** — fractional trailing vs swing-based rulebook mismatch.
- **EM-M1 (Medium)** — broker holds only SL + TP1; rest is software-only.
- **EM-M2 (Medium)** — instant-fill entry vs sized/validated midpoint.
- **EM-L1 (Low)** — `ProcessorOutput` contract triplicated by hand.
- **EM-V1 (Verify)** — `broker_bridge.py` MT5 `order_send` SL/TP attachment still unread.

It also records the parts verified **correct** for completeness, and a priority fix order (EM-C1, EM-C2 → EM-H1 → EM-V1 → rest). The note in `!76` `merge_status` shows `can_merge: false` for me (Developer role), so you'll need to merge it from your owner account.

Want me to start the fixes? I'd recommend a single MR closing EM-C1, EM-C2, and EM-H1 (the money-affecting restart/synthetic bugs), reading `broker_bridge.py` (EM-V1) as part of it.





NOW HOW EXACTLY DO YOU THINK IS THE ENTERPRISE GRADE AND INDUSTRY STANDARD TO HANDLE THE TP1, TP2, TP3 ISSUE?
EXPLAIN IN SIMPLE, CLEAR AND UNDERSTANDABLE FORM




#### The core problem in plain terms

Right now your three take-profits (TP1, TP2, TP3) live **only in the running program's memory** and **at the broker only TP1 exists**. If Module C restarts, it reloads the trade from the database, but the database never saved the split percentages (40%/30%/30% etc.), so it reloads them as zero. The software then tries to close "0% of the position" at each TP, which closes nothing. So your profit-taking quietly stops working after any restart. That is the bug. The question is: what does a serious trading shop do so this can never happen?

#### The enterprise principle: the broker is the source of truth, your software is the backup, and the database is the memory

Professional systems follow one rule: **never let a managed position depend on a process staying alive.** A server can crash, redeploy, lose network, or get OOM-killed at any second. So the safe design has three layers, in priority order.

**1. Push as much as possible to the broker itself (primary protection).** The broker keeps working even if all your servers are down. At minimum, the **stop loss must always sit at the broker** (it does). For take-profits, the industry-standard approach is to **split the position into separate child positions at entry** — e.g. open three positions (or one position you immediately treat as three legs), and attach TP1 to leg 1, TP2 to leg 2, TP3 to leg 3, each as a real broker-side TP order. Now the broker takes profit automatically with zero dependency on your code. This is the gold standard and is what most prop firms and execution desks do. MT5 supports this directly (multiple positions, each with its own TP, plus OCO-style logic).

**2. Persist the FULL intent in the database (durable memory).** Whatever your software is responsible for managing must be written to the database the moment the trade is filled, and reloaded completely on restart. That means the schema must store `tp1_price, tp1_pct, tp2_price, tp2_pct, tp3_price, tp3_pct, point, digits` and the runtime state (`tp1_hit`, `tp2_hit`, `remaining_lot`, `breakeven_set`, current SL). On restart you reconstruct the **exact** trade, not a lossy copy. The rule of thumb: **the database row must be a complete snapshot, so a brand-new process with no memory can fully resume.** This is the immediate fix for your bug.

**3. Reconcile against the broker on every startup (truth check).** When Module C boots, before it trusts anything, it asks the broker "what positions and volumes actually exist right now?" and compares them to its database. If the broker says the remaining lot is 0.5 but the DB thinks it's 1.0, the broker wins and the DB is corrected. This catches partial closes that happened while the service was down, manual closes, and TP hits at the broker. You already have a reconciler, but it must drive the restored state, not just import orphans.

#### How those layers fit together for TP1/TP2/TP3

The cleanest enterprise pattern for your exact case:

- **At fill:** split into three legs (or record three target orders) and place each TP at the broker. Write all three prices + pcts + the runtime flags to the database in the same transaction as registering the trade.
- **While running:** your software's job shrinks to the things the broker *can't* do natively — moving SL to breakeven after TP1, structural trailing, news/structural invalidation. It reacts to broker fills (TP1 filled → move SL to BE) rather than being the thing that *causes* the TP fill.
- **On restart:** reload the full trade from the DB, then reconcile with the broker. Because the TPs are real broker orders, even a long outage can't stop them firing.

#### Why this is better than what you have

Today TP2/TP3 only happen if your code is alive, polling ticks, and remembers the percentages. That's three single points of failure stacked on top of each other. The enterprise approach removes all three: the broker fires the TPs (no liveness dependency), the database holds the full plan (no memory-loss dependency), and reconciliation fixes any drift (no "I missed an event while down" dependency).

#### The pragmatic two-step path for you

1. **Immediate, mandatory:** fix the persistence (EM-C1/EM-C2) — add the pct/point/digits/runtime-state columns and restore them fully. This stops the silent bug right now even while TP2/TP3 stay software-managed.
2. **Proper, target state:** move TP1/TP2/TP3 to **broker-side bracket/child orders** so profit-taking survives any outage, and reduce your software to SL-to-BE, trailing, and invalidation — with startup reconciliation against the broker as the safety net.


Step 1 is the bug fix; step 2 is what makes it genuinely enterprise-grade and production-safe. Want me to implement step 1 now and write up step 2 as a design task in the audit doc?

I DON'T NEED ANY RUBBISH AND DISOBEDIENCE






Now I have everything I need for the management-side fixes. I have ground truth on: `Trade` (pct is `int32`), `TradeRecord`, schema, `InsertTrade`/restore, `breakeven.go`, `trailing.go`, constants, broker `Port` (has `GetPosition` returning `Volume`/`StopLoss`/`TakeProfit` — needed for EM-C2 fallback and reconcile-on-restart), and `main.go` restore.

Now I'll establish a tracking section and the implementation plan, then execute in moderate, verifiable commit steps. Let me first lay out the precise plan so progress is trackable, then start committing.

#### Implementation plan (enterprise-grade, all findings, committed in steps)

I will fix every finding from the audit doc. Here is the exact, fully-wired plan, each step = one commit on a single working branch `fix/execution-management-hardening`:

- **Step 1 — EM-C1 + EM-C2 (persistence schema/model):** Add `tp1_pct, tp2_pct, tp3_pct, point, digits, rr_ratio, slippage` and the runtime-state columns (`current_sl` already exists as `stop_loss`; add `tp1_hit, tp2_hit, tp3_hit, breakeven_set, remaining_lot_size`) to `management_trades` via idempotent `ALTER`s in `SchemaSQL`; add fields to `TradeRecord`; update `InsertTrade`, `GetActiveTrades`, `GetAllActiveTrades`, `GetTradeByBrokerOrderID` columns + scans.
- **Step 2 — EM-C1/C2 wiring:** Update `RegisterFilledTrade` `InsertTrade{...}` to write the new fields; add a journal `UpdateTradeRuntimeState` (or extend existing) so `tp_hit`/`remaining`/`breakeven` persist as they change (called from takeprofit/breakeven); update `restoreTradeFromRecord` in `main.go` to restore ALL fields. This makes restart fully lossless.
- **Step 3 — EM-C2/EM-H1 (synthetic pip):** Add a canonical `PipValueForSymbol(symbol, point)` helper in management constants (synthetic-aware, mirroring the engine), replace `tradePoint*10` in `breakeven.go`, and add a `Point=0` broker-fallback (fetch from `GetPosition`) so restored trades self-heal.
- **Step 4 — EM-C1 restart self-heal + reconcile:** On restore, if a trade has `RemainingLotSize==0`/`Point==0`/pct==0 from a pre-migration row, backfill `RemainingLotSize=TotalLotSize`, fetch `Point` and `Volume` from `GetPosition`, and re-derive pct from `TPSplitByStyle[style]` as a safe fallback. Persist back.
- **Step 5 — EM-M1:** Document + harden: confirm broker holds SL+TP1; add startup reconciliation of remaining volume against `GetPosition` so software state matches broker truth.
- **Step 6 — EM-V1:** Read `broker_bridge.py`, verify/fix MT5 `order_send` SL/TP attachment.
- **Step 7 — EM-L1:** Make `make contract-check` a hard CI gate (CI yaml).
- **Step 8 — EM-H2 / EM-M2:** Decide structural-trail wiring vs documented downgrade; recompute risk from fill on instant.
- **Step 9:** Update audit doc statuses, open/refresh MR.

I'll start with Step 1 now (the schema + model — the foundation). Let me reconsider scope to avoid a too-heavy single commit: I'll do schema `ALTER`s + `CREATE TABLE` columns + `TradeRecord` fields + all four read/write queries together, since they are tightly coupled and must compile as a unit.

Before I write Step 1, I want to confirm one detail to avoid a guess: whether a journal method exists to update runtime state mid-trade (so I don't create a duplicate). I read `repository.go` fully earlier — it has `UpdateTradeClose`, `UpdateTradeSL`, `UpdateTradePartial`. There is no runtime-state persistence for `tp1_hit/breakeven/remaining`. So `UpdateTradeSL` should also persist nothing extra; I'll add a focused `UpdateTradeRuntime`. 

Let me update the tracking section in the audit doc first (so progress is recoverable if the chat ends), then immediately do Step 1's schema+model+queries commit.


================================================================================
## IMPLEMENTATION TRACKER (fix/execution-management-hardening)
================================================================================

Full end-to-end re-trace completed and verified against source on `main`
(not assumed). Confirmed facts that shape the fix:

  - Proto RegisterFilledTradeRequest carries tp1/2/3_pct, point, digits,
    rr_ratio (fields 6-26). Getters exist and compile.
  - Gateway NotifyExecutionCompleted populates the full request AND fetches
    live point/digits from /internal/broker/symbol_info. Real values flow.
  - Execution INSTANT fill -> watcher.fireMarketOrder (broker gets SL+TP1)
    -> gateway -> management RegisterFilledTrade. Full intent reaches C.
  - Execution LIMIT fill -> executor.placeLimit (broker gets SL+TP1) -> TTL
    watcher only. ON FILL THERE IS NO NotifyExecutionCompleted. The trade
    reaches C ONLY via management StateReconciler orphan-import, which sets
    tp*_pct=0, no TP2/TP3, point=0, style=INTRADAY, risk=0. => EM-C1/EM-C2
    hit EVERY limit trade in steady state, not only after restart.
  - Journal layer (models.go, repository.go incl. UpdateTradeRuntime) is
    MERGED and complete; UpdateTradeRuntime is not yet called anywhere.
  - grpc_server.RegisterFilledTrade InsertTrade{} omits tp*_pct, point,
    digits, rr_ratio, remaining_lot_size, flags (write-path loss).
  - main.restoreTradeFromRecord omits the same and hard-codes
    RemainingLotSize=TotalLotSize (restore-path loss).
  - breakeven.go buffer uses point*10 (FX-only). Canonical model proven in
    execution mt5/bridge.go GetInstrumentInfo: pip=point*10 for digits>2,
    pip=point for digits<=2, pip=1.0 for synthetics.
  - EM-V1 VERIFIED: MetaApi place_order sends stopLoss/takeProfit; ZMQ
    place_order sends stop_loss/take_profit. Filled orders carry broker
    SL+TP1. Only TP1 broker-side (EM-M1 confirmed; not naked).

Commit steps (each step compiles as a unit):
  [x] S0  audit tracker (this section)
  [x] S1  EM-C1/C2 write+restore: grpc_server InsertTrade + main restore
  [x] S2  EM-C1 runtime persistence: call UpdateTradeRuntime from
          takeprofit/executor.go (post-partial) and stoploss/breakeven.go
          (post-BE). Time-tighten only moves SL -> UpdateTradeSL suffices.
  [x] S3  EM-H1: PipSize(symbol,point,digits) helper in management
          constants (mirrors execution bridge.go); used in breakeven.go
          buffer. EM-C2 self-heal of Point/Digits via NEW broker
          GetSymbolInfo (symbol_info endpoint; position has no point) +
          journal.UpdateTradePointDigits. trailing.go has no pip-buffer
          term (it trails a fraction of the move), so EM-H1 does not apply
          there; its concern is EM-H2 (S6).
  [x] S4  EM-C1 (LIMIT path, CRITICAL): runLimitTTL now runs a fast
          fillTicker + checkLimitFillAndHandoff; on fill it stamps the
          real position ticket and calls NotifyExecutionCompleted with
          full intent (idempotent downstream). matchFilledPosition
          correlates by AnalysisID then unambiguous symbol+direction.
          Reconciler import remains the manual/external fallback.
  [~] S5  EM-M1: PARTIAL — StateReconciler.processPositionUpdate adopts
          broker remaining-volume as source of truth each frame +
          persists via UpdateTradeRuntime. Broker-side OCO bracket for
          TP2/TP3 deferred (deliberate future enhancement).
  [x] S6  EM-H2: trailing.go contract doc aligned to the implemented
          fractional model; swing trail recorded as future enhancement.
  [x] S7  EM-M2: fireMarketOrder recomputes realized RiskAmount from the
          actual instant fill price before handoff.
  [x] S8  EM-L1: local `make contract-check` is now a hard gate (CI was
          already hard-gated via the lint job + needs: lint).
  [x] S9  finding statuses flipped above; MR opened.

Progress note: ALL steps complete. EM-C1, EM-C2, EM-C3, EM-H1, EM-H2,
EM-M1, EM-M2, EM-L1 = DONE; EM-V1 = VERIFIED.

EM-C3 (CRITICAL, found during EM-M1 verification): broker-side TP was set
to TP1 on the full volume (would close 100% at TP1, defeating TP2/TP3 +
BE + trailing) AND BE/trailing ModifyPosition(newTP=0) wiped the broker
TP. Fixed: broker TP = final target (TP3->TP2->TP1) at placement via
Order/Trade.BrokerTakeProfit(); all SL moves preserve it. EM-M1 upgraded
to DONE as a consequence (broker now holds a real SL+TP3 bracket).

EM-H2 remains a deliberate doc-alignment (fractional trail) because the
CANDLE_CLOSED alert (src/alert/event.go) carries NO swing levels, so a
true swing trail needs a new candle fetch into Module C (the EA exposes a
CANDLES command, so it is feasible as a future enhancement) — not a silent
claim. No price/value is hardcoded anywhere in these fixes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### SL-management scenarios — end-to-end trace (verified active)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Worker (monitoring/worker.go) calls be.Evaluate then trail.Evaluate every
tick, in order SL -> TP -> BE -> trail. All three SL behaviours traced:
  1. Standard break-even (breakeven.go Evaluate): scalping triggers at 60%
     of distance to TP1 (ScalpBEThreshold); intraday/swing/positional
     trigger when price reaches TP1. Moves SL to entry +/- SpreadBufferPips
     * PipSize. ACTIVE.
  2. Intraday 3-hour time-tighten (breakeven.go applyTimeTightening):
     intraday branch, when TP1 not reached within IntradayBETimeoutHours;
     SL tightened to IntradaySLReductionPct of original risk. ACTIVE.
  3. Post-BE fractional trail (trailing.go Evaluate): returns early unless
     BreakevenSet; trails trailFractionForStyle of the move, +0.10 after
     TP1, tighten-only. ACTIVE (depends on #1 having set BreakevenSet,
     which is now persisted -> survives restart).
All three now call ModifyPosition with BrokerTakeProfit() (not 0).

EM-C3 FOLLOW-UP (regression I introduced + fixed in the same MR):
re-sending TP3 on every SL move risked the EA rejecting the whole modify
when price neared TP3 (ValidateStopLevels gates SL+TP together). Fixed in
ZeroMQ_EA.mq5 HandlePositionModify: SL and TP are now validated
INDEPENDENTLY; a too-close/zero TP preserves the position's existing TP
and the SL move always proceeds. MetaApi modifies SL/TP as independent
fields, so both backends are safe.

EM-V1 FULLY VERIFIED to the EA: HandleOrderSend attaches request.sl +
request.tp on OrderSend (market + pending); HandlePositionModify,
HandlePositionClosePartial, HandlePositionClose, ValidateStopLevels and
NormalizePrice all read. Native ZMQ + MetaApi + broker_bridge.py all
confirmed to carry SL/TP. No EA layer left unread.

================================================================================
## EM FOLLOW-UP HARDENING (fix/em-followup-hardening)
================================================================================

Four lower-severity issues found while re-auditing the post-fix flow
against source on `main` (none contradict the prior DONE claims; all
backed by read code).

  [x] EM-F1 (LOW, data race) takeprofit/executor.go Evaluate snapshotted
      runtime values under RLock, then called trade.IsTP1Hit/IsTP2Hit/
      IsTP3Hit(checkPrice) which read t.TP*Price + t.IsLong() WITHOUT a
      lock. Fields are immutable post-registration so it is functionally
      safe, but it is a `go test -race` violation. FIX: compare against
      the already-snapshotted tp*Price + a snapshotted isLong; no Trade
      method touches the struct outside the lock window.

  [x] EM-F2 (MEDIUM, plan loss) monitoring/sync.go imported every broker
      position as a BARE trade: TradingStyle hard-coded INTRADAY, TP2/TP3
      = 0, RiskAmount = 0, Point = 0 -- even when the position is one of
      OUR OWN system trades whose full plan already exists in
      management_trades (the handoff-failure case). FIX: before a bare
      import, GetTradeByBrokerOrderID recovers the real system row and
      registers THAT (full TP1/2/3+pct, style, risk, rr, point/digits).
      A genuinely manual/external position (no system row) is imported
      with constants.StyleManualDefault = POSITIONAL -- the SAFEST style
      (no 3h intraday SL-tighten, no 16:30 intraday EOD hard-close,
      widest trail) so an unknown trade is never closed/tightened
      prematurely. Applied in BOTH RunStartupSync and
      processPositionUpdate.

  [x] EM-F3 (LOW, check-then-act) stoploss/breakeven.go applyTimeTightening
      read currentSL under RLock then mutated under a separate Lock. FIX:
      fold the read-compare-write into one write-lock window so the
      tighten cannot race a concurrent SL move.

  [x] EM-F4 (LOW, journaling) takeprofit/executor.go fetchClosedDealProfit
      returned the most-recent deal matching the position ticket; a near-
      simultaneous TP2/TP3 close could attribute the wrong leg's PnL to
      the journal. FIX: prefer the most-recent matching deal whose
      |Volume - closeVol| <= lot epsilon, then fall back to most-recent
      by position. PnL journaling only; not money-affecting at broker.

Style decision (EM-F2): NOT blindly SWING and NOT blindly INTRADAY.
When the adopted position is our own trade we recover the TRUE style
from the DB. When it is genuinely manual we use POSITIONAL because it
has the least aggressive automated interference, so we never prematurely
manage a trade whose intent we cannot know. The broker SL/TP always
protects it regardless.

Progress:
  [x] S1 EM-F1 takeprofit lock-clean hit checks (tpReached helper; no
         Trade method called outside the lock window)
  [x] S2 EM-F2 reconciler recover-system-row + POSITIONAL manual default
         (buildReconciledTrade; GetTradeByBrokerOrderID recovery first,
         StyleManualDefault=POSITIONAL fallback; both import sites
         delegate to the single helper; RemainingLotSize now persisted
         on the manual-import row too)
  [x] S3 EM-F3 breakeven time-tighten read-compare-write under one
         write lock + rollback of provisional SL on broker failure
  [x] S4 EM-F4 partial-close PnL volume-matched attribution
         (closeVol threaded through poll/fetch; prefer volume-matched
         OUT deal, fall back to most-recent matching deal)
  [x] S5 statuses flipped + MR opened

ALL EM-F items DONE. No price/value hardcoded; POSITIONAL chosen as the
safest manual-default style (full management still runs, only the
intraday-specific 3h SL-tighten + 16:30 EOD hard-close are avoided).
Manual trades carry the trader's single broker TP as TP1; TP2/TP3 stay
unset because the trader expressed one target (not fabricated).
