# eTradie Deployment Progress Log

> Per-deploy record of progress through [`docs/runbooks/README.md`](README.md).
> A new deploy (different operator, different VPS, different environment)
> starts by copying this file, blanking the per-deploy parameters below,
> and clearing the status board back to `⏸ pending`.
>
> This file does NOT re-document the runbook. README.md is canonical; here
> we only record which phases finished and any deploy-specific outcomes
> a future-you (or a hand-off operator) needs to know to pick up safely.

## Phase 0 — Prerequisites ✅

Executed README.md Phase 0 (0.1–0.4) against the staging tag column.
Every 0.4 line returned `200`; mt-node empty as expected. No deviations.

**Deploy-specific outcomes:**
- Paddle + Lemon Squeezy credentials NOT in hand. Phase 8.9 will write
  random plausibly-formatted values into Vault so the billing service
  passes its startup fail-fast; real values to be swapped in later via
  `vault kv put` + `kubectl rollout restart deployment/etradie-billing`.

## Phase 1 — VPS host hardening 🔄

Executing README.md Phase 1 against the staging VPS. Sub-steps below
are flipped as each one passes its verification.

| Sub-step | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1.1 Create non-root sudo user `etradie`, install SSH key | ✅ | Discovered `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` was empty on the Contabo image (operator had been root-logging in via password). Installed the workstation's `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` into BOTH `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` and `/home/etradie/.ssh/authorized_keys` so the root escape hatch stays intact until 1.2 verification. Second-terminal `ssh etradie@HOST` succeeded key-only; `sudo whoami` returned `root`. |
| 1.2 Harden sshd via `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/10-etradie-hardening.conf` | ✅ | `sshd -T` confirms `passwordauthentication no`, `permitrootlogin no`, `pubkeyauthentication yes`, `kbdinteractiveauthentication no`. Second-terminal verification: password-auth attempt refused (no password prompt at all); `ssh root@HOST` refused; `ssh etradie@HOST` succeeded. |
| 1.3 OS packages + updates | ✅ | `apt -y upgrade` pulled 96 pending packages including a kernel update to `6.8.0-124-generic` (system flagged restart-required). `needrestart` deferred dbus / systemd-logind / unattended-upgrades restarts — cleared by the reboot scheduled after 1.5. All 10 packages (`ca-certificates curl gnupg git make jq unzip ufw chrony fail2ban`) Status: install ok installed. |
| 1.4 Time sync (chrony) | ✅ | `chronyc tracking`: Stratum 2, Leap status Normal, system time within 1ms of NTP. `chronyc sources -v` shows one `^*` selected source + multiple `^+` candidates, all with Reach 377. |
| 1.5 Kernel + ulimit tuning | ✅ | `/etc/sysctl.d/99-etradie.conf` and `/etc/security/limits.d/99-etradie.conf` written exactly per README.md. `sudo sysctl --system` applied the drop-in; runtime verify shows `vm.max_map_count=262144`, `fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288`, `net.core.somaxconn=65535`, `vm.swappiness=10`. ulimit values via PAM apply only to NEW sessions and to processes not launched by systemd (K3s + Vault + workloads use systemd `LimitNOFILE=` and container runtime per-pod limits, independent of PAM). |
| Reboot to pick up kernel `6.8.0-124-generic` | ✅ | Box came back in ~60s. `uname -r` = `6.8.0-124-generic`, sshd hardening persists (`passwordauthentication no`, `permitrootlogin no`, `pubkeyauthentication yes`), all 4 sysctl values still applied, chrony re-synced (Stratum 3, Leap Normal), `/var/run/reboot-required` cleared. Key-only `ssh etradie@HOST` still works (validates the hardening + ufw inactive precondition for 1.6). |
| 1.6 Firewall — ufw default-deny inbound | ✅ | ufw active; default deny incoming / allow outgoing; only `22/tcp LIMIT IN` (v4+v6) rule. `ss -tlnp` shows sshd on `:22` plus two `systemd-resolved` stub listeners on `127.0.0.54:53` and `127.0.0.53%lo:53` (loopback only, not public-facing). External port probe from workstation against `13.140.164.173`: 22 OPEN; 80, 443, 6443, 8200, 5432 all closed/filtered. Fresh `ssh etradie@HOST` from a second terminal still succeeds. |
| 1.7 fail2ban sshd jail | ✅ | `/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/sshd.local` written per README.md. `systemctl is-active fail2ban` -> `active`; `is-enabled` -> `enabled`. `fail2ban-client status` shows 1 jail (`sshd`); `status sshd` reports `Currently failed: 1` (the deliberate `ssh root@HOST` rejection from 1.2 verification) and `Currently banned: 0` — well under `maxretry = 3`, so no IP is banned. Journal monitoring via systemd (`_SYSTEMD_UNIT=sshd.service`) rather than tailing `/var/log/auth.log` (Ubuntu 24.04 default). Benign `WARNING 'allowipv6' not defined` in journal — fail2ban defaulted to `auto`, IPv6 still covered. |
| 1.8 Verification checklist | ✅ | All 9 checks pass: sshd hardening intact, fail2ban sshd jail active (`Currently banned: 0`; the small `Currently failed` count reflects the 1.2 / 1.8 verification rejections), ufw default-deny with only `22/tcp LIMIT IN` (v4+v6), chrony Stratum 3 / Leap Normal, all 4 sysctl values applied, K3s `:6443` not yet listening (correct pre-Phase-2), `ss -tlnp` confirms NO public listener other than sshd, no reboot pending, `sudo -n whoami` -> `root`. Host is ready for Phase 2 (K3s install). |
